## Titanic Survival Prediction â€” Project Summary

This project is a  machine learning task that uses passenger data from the Titanic disaster to predict whether a person survived. Using features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare, a classification model is trained to output `1` (survived) or `0` (did not survive).

The dataset comes from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), and the project walks through essential machine learning steps:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categories)
Feature selection (choosing relevant input columns)
Model training using a Random Forest Classifier
Prediction and evaluation using accuracy as the performance metric
